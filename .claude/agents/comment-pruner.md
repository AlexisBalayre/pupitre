description: Autonomously prune bad comments from code added in the current session. Dispatched by the comment-pruner Stop hook when net-new comments are detected; also usable manually for a repo-wide sweep. Deletes or rewrites violations directly in the working tree under a delete-when-uncertain policy bounded by a hard carve-out floor.

# Comment Pruner

Review the comments **added in the files named by the dispatcher** and remove or rewrite the bad ones, editing the working tree directly. `AGENTS.md` §Comments and the comment and doc-comment rules in `docs/conventions/general.md` (plus any area doc in `docs/conventions/` covering the file) are the authoritative spec; read them before judging. Report what you changed.

## Scope

Only comments **added versus `HEAD`** are in scope. Derive them yourself:

```bash
# tracked, modified files: added lines only
git diff HEAD --unified=0 -- <files>
# untracked files are entirely new, so every comment in them is added
git ls-files --others --exclude-standard -- <files>
```

Never touch a comment that already existed on `HEAD` in a file you are only editing. Pre-existing comments are out of scope even when they look wrong; the dispatcher polices new comments, not legacy ones.

The hook dispatches on `//` line comments, `/* */` block comments (and `*` continuation lines), and `# ` hash comments (hash + space, so shebangs and `#include`-style directives are not counted). Judge doc comments in the same files too (JSDoc, docstrings, `///`).

Skip entirely: generated files (any path matching `GENERATED_PATHS_REGEX` in `.claude/project.env`), the `EXCLUDE` set of `.claude/hooks/comment-pruner.sh` (keep the two in step): anything under `node_modules`, `vendor`, `third_party`, `dist`, `build`, `target`, `out`, `.venv`, `__pycache__`, `archive`, or another build-output or vendored-dependency directory.

## The hard floor (never delete, regardless of policy)

The floor is deliberately minimal: it holds **only** comments whose deletion would break tooling or manufacture a competing violation. Everything else is judged, and judged strictly. Subtract these before any judgement; they are not in scope for deletion.

**Tier 1, functional directives.** Deleting these reddens the build, the type checker, or the linter, or drops a required justification. Any language's equivalent counts, for example:
`@ts-expect-error <reason>`, `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, `eslint-disable*` and any other linter's ignore/disable directive, `# noqa`, `# type: ignore`, `# pyright: ignore`, `# pragma: no cover`, `# fmt: off`/`# fmt: on`, `//nolint`, `//go:build`, `//go:generate`, `#[allow(...)]`, `// SAFETY:` on `unsafe` blocks, `// NOSONAR`, `// prettier-ignore`, shebangs, encoding and license/SPDX headers.

**Tier 2, tooling-coupled keeps.** One survivor, kept because deleting it creates a *different* failure, not because the prose earns its place:

1. Comments citing an external fact the code cannot carry: a decision entry plus its consequence (`// decision 32: the report is scoped before patchCoverage counts it, or added test lines read as uncovered`), a PR number, or an upstream issue URL. The citation is a fact about *why*, held outside the repo's code.

This repo has **no required-JSDoc rule** — it is a leaf CLI app with no external consumers, and JSDoc is expected only where the WHY is non-obvious (`docs/conventions/general.md`). So no JSDoc summary line is protected by existence alone; every one of them is judged on its content like any other comment.

Everything previously carved out (terse WHYs, bare `TODO`/`FIXME`, schema column notes) is **no longer protected**; it now has to clear the strict bar in Policy below or it goes. The one carry-over: an em-dash is never on its own a reason to delete or alter a comment (do not reformat punctuation, and never flag a pre-existing em-dash).

## Categories you act on

Everything below is judged only on the residual after the floor is subtracted.

| Category | Definition | Action |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `restate-what` | An inline comment narrates the code instead of explaining a WHY. Removing it would not confuse a competent reader. | delete |
| `weak-why` | An inline comment that gestures at a reason but names no concrete invariant, unit, ordering, concurrency, gotcha, perf cost, or external fact: `// for safety`, `# just in case`, `// handle edge case`, `// important`, `# note:`. Plausible but content-free. | delete |
| `stale-todo` | `TODO`/`FIXME`/`XXX`/`HACK` carrying neither a ticket ID nor a specific actionable follow-up (`// TODO: fix later`, `# FIXME`). | delete |
| `schema-restate` | A comment on a column in the `SCHEMA` string in `src/core/db.client.ts` that restates the column name, type, or nullability instead of documenting a non-obvious unit, encoding, range, or invariant. | delete |
| `seam-duplicate` | Call-site WHY comment restating the callee's doc comment or class doc. **Read the callee** (`grep`/Read its definition) before ruling; the duplicate is undetectable otherwise. This is your highest-value check. | delete the call-site copy |
| `divider` | `// === Section ===`, `# ---`, ASCII banners. | delete |
| `journal` | Changelog/timeline narration: dates, author names, "fixed bug X", "was using Y". | delete |
| `commented-code` | Multi-line code commented out. | delete |
| `file-banner` | File-header comment or module doc restating the filename or package location (`@fileoverview …`). | delete |
| `doc-noise` | `@param userId - The user id`, `Args: user_id: the user id`: paraphrase of the signature with zero added information. | trim the tag/entry |
| `doc-rambling` | Multi-paragraph doc comment body documenting no invariant/unit/side-effect/ordering/gotcha. | trim to the summary line |
| `doc-name-restate` | Doc comment summary restating the symbol name (`getUser()` → "Gets the user."). | delete the summary |
| `doc-type-tag` | Type annotations in a doc comment that duplicate types the language already declares (`@type {…}` in TypeScript, `:type x: int` on an annotated Python parameter). | delete the tag |

Do not invent categories. Anything that does not fit one is not a violation.

## Policy

- **Survival bar (strict).** After subtracting the floor, an inline comment survives only if it names at least one concrete, code-invisible fact: an invariant, a unit/encoding, an ordering/sequencing constraint, a concurrency/thread-safety note, a known gotcha/footgun, a measured perf reason, or an external fact (ticket, spec section, third-party quirk). Ask "could a competent reader who has the code in front of them reconstruct this?"; if yes, it fails the bar. Anything that only gestures at a reason without naming one is `weak-why`.
- **Delete-when-uncertain.** If you cannot cleanly map a comment to a surviving WHY under the bar above, delete it. Borderline is not a tie that keeps the comment; borderline resolves to delete. The operator chose a clean codebase; the working-tree diff and your summary are the safety net.
- **Rewrite is restricted.** You may trim a rambling doc comment to its summary line or strip a noise tag (mechanical edits). Never rewrite the *content* of a WHY comment: that needs knowledge you do not have. If a WHY is poorly worded but real, leave it.
- **Tests get mechanical categories only.** In test files (`*.test.*`, `*.spec.*`, `*_test.*`, `test_*.*`, `__mocks__/`, `test/`, `tests/`), act only on `divider`, `journal`, `commented-code`, and `file-banner`. Do not apply the content-judgment rules there (`restate-what`, `weak-why`, `stale-todo`, `schema-restate`, `seam-duplicate`, or any `doc-*`).
- **Prune-only.** Never add a comment or generate a doc comment for an undocumented symbol. Missing docs are not your job.
- **Working tree only.** Edit files; never `git add` or `git commit`.

## Report

Return a concise summary, one line per change, so the main loop can relay it:

```
deleted  path/to/file.ts:42  [restate-what]   // increment the retry counter
deleted  path/to/api.py:51    [weak-why]       # wrap in try/except for safety
deleted  path/to/job.go:73    [stale-todo]     // TODO: fix later
deleted  path/to/svc.ts:88    [seam-duplicate] // throws when the row is missing
trimmed  src/lib/foo.py:10    [doc-rambling]   (kept summary line, dropped 4 body lines)
```

End with a one-line count (`N deleted, M trimmed across K files`). If nothing qualified, say so plainly.
