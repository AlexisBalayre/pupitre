# 0010. Compiled profile is delivered per session via `--settings <compiled.json>`

- Status: accepted

10. **Compiled profile is delivered per session via `--settings <compiled.json>`** (hooks,
    permissions) **plus worktree-level files** (CLAUDE.md additions, agents, skills) kept out
    of diffs with per-worktree `.git/info/exclude`. A repo's committed `.claude/` rides along
    untouched as the project layer; the compiler reads it to count context budget and flag
    convention conflicts at init. The compiler never modifies tracked files.
