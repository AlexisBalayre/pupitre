# 0018. Context is optimized by handoff-respawn, not in-place compaction (2026-07-23)

- Status: accepted

18. **Context is optimized by handoff-respawn, not in-place compaction (2026-07-23).**
    `pup respawn <session>` steers the session to write a handoff document
    (`~/.pupitre/<project>/sessions/<id>/handoff.md`), waits for the explicit
    `pup session handoff-done` protocol signal, then relaunches `claude` in the same
    worktree/branch/session-id with compiled context + handoff as the kickoff. The session
    row is untouched — same session, fresh window. Rationale over `/compact`: the handoff is
    a Pupitre-owned, human-inspectable artifact that survives crashes, and the agent
    distills what matters rather than a lossy black-box summary. Context size is read from
    transcript JSONL usage fields (decision 2 — never pane scraping); `pup status` shows
    `ctx ~Nk` per running session and suggests a respawn above 120k tokens.
