# 0009. Sessions inherit the user's `~/.claude` (revised 2026-07-22, supersedes full `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` isolation)

- Status: accepted

9. **Sessions inherit the user's `~/.claude` (revised 2026-07-22, supersedes full
   `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` isolation).** Rationale: an isolated config dir has no login state, and
   every workaround (setup-token, keychain replication) is programmatic access that plan policy
   could restrict — inheriting the normal interactive login makes a session indistinguishable
   from the user running `claude` in a terminal. Attributability is preserved by snapshotting
   and hashing the user config at session launch (drift is detected, not prevented); the
   profile hash covers compiled output + user-config snapshot hash.
