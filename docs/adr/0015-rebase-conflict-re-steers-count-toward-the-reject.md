# 0015. Rebase-conflict re-steers count toward the reject cap

- Status: accepted

15. **Rebase-conflict re-steers count toward the reject cap.** One counter (`reject_count`)
    bounds every automatic re-steer path; after two, the third failure of any kind parks the
    session as `blocked`. Conflicts are not tracked separately.
