# Resolved decisions (2026-07-22)

Outcome of the design review. Where this file contradicts 00–08, this file wins; folding the
changes back into those docs is pending.

## Runtime & control plane

1. **Sessions are interactive `claude` in tmux panes**, one per worktree. tmux is transport only
   (launch, steer via `paste-buffer`, kill, human attach). Headless mode is dropped for sessions.
2. **All session state comes from hooks and transcript JSONL**, never from pane contents.
   PostToolUse = activity, Notification = blocked on input, Stop = turn end. Hooks identify their
   session via a `PUP_SESSION_ID` env var injected at launch.
3. **Task completion is an explicit protocol**: the base profile requires the agent to run
   `pup session done "<summary>"` when acceptance criteria are met. The command refuses on a dirty
   worktree. A Stop without the done event means idle-awaiting-input, not done.
4. Steering cannot force-interrupt a mid-turn agent; steer messages queue until the turn ends.
   Accepted limitation.
18. **Context is optimized by handoff-respawn, not in-place compaction (2026-07-23).**
    `pup respawn <session>` steers the session to write a handoff document
    (`~/.pupitre/<project>/sessions/<id>/handoff.md`), waits for the explicit
    `pup session handoff-done` protocol signal, then relaunches `claude` in the same
    worktree/branch/session-id with compiled context + handoff as the kickoff. The session
    row is untouched — same session, fresh window. Rationale over `/compact`: the handoff is
    a Pupitre-owned, human-inspectable artifact that survives crashes, and the agent
    distills what matters rather than a lossy black-box summary. Context size is read from
    transcript JSONL usage fields (decision 2 — never pane scraping); `pup status` shows
    `ctx ~Nk` per running session and suggests a respawn above 120k tokens.

## Safety & enforcement

5. **Sessions run with permissions bypassed; compiled hooks are the enforcement layer.**
   Scope-in globs on Edit/Write; deny-patterns on Bash.
6. **Bash scope checking is best-effort**: a real shell parser denies clear write patterns
   (`>`, `>>`, `tee`, `sed -i`, `rm`/`mv`/`cp`, `git apply`…) whose resolved target is out of scope
   or inside `.claude/`. Unparseable commands pass. The authoritative backstop is the gate:
   diff-vs-scope is a hard fail, and a `.claude/` drift-hash mismatch is a hard fail.
7. **Rejection→re-steer is capped at 2.** A third gate failure parks the session as
   `blocked — needs human`, surfaced at the top of `pup status` with the failure history.

## Merge semantics

8. **Fresh-base gating**: the gate refuses branches that are stale vs main. **Pupitre auto-rebases
   mechanically**; only conflicts go back to the session as a re-steer ("rebase onto main and
   resolve"). Merges are serialized under a lock.

15. **Rebase-conflict re-steers count toward the reject cap.** One counter (`reject_count`)
    bounds every automatic re-steer path; after two, the third failure of any kind parks the
    session as `blocked`. Conflicts are not tracked separately.
16. **Merge is `--ff-only` with full cleanup.** After the auto-rebase the branch is a
    descendant of the target, so the merge fast-forwards (linear history). On pass:
    session → `merged`, tmux killed, worktree removed, branch deleted — everything is in main.
17. **Diff-size flag blocks unless `--accept-debt`.** The v1 soft stage follows stage-4
    semantics from 04-gates-and-debt: a flagged oversize diff refuses to merge unless
    `--accept-debt "<reason>" --review-by "<condition>"` is passed, which writes a ledger
    entry. Threshold is a tunable constant; lockfiles are excluded from the count.

## Config & profiles

9. **Sessions inherit the user's `~/.claude` (revised 2026-07-22, supersedes full
   `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` isolation).** Rationale: an isolated config dir has no login state, and
   every workaround (setup-token, keychain replication) is programmatic access that plan policy
   could restrict — inheriting the normal interactive login makes a session indistinguishable
   from the user running `claude` in a terminal. Attributability is preserved by snapshotting
   and hashing the user config at session launch (drift is detected, not prevented); the
   profile hash covers compiled output + user-config snapshot hash.
10. **Compiled profile is delivered per session via `--settings <compiled.json>`** (hooks,
    permissions) **plus worktree-level files** (CLAUDE.md additions, agents, skills) kept out
    of diffs with per-worktree `.git/info/exclude`. A repo's committed `.claude/` rides along
    untouched as the project layer; the compiler reads it to count context budget and flag
    convention conflicts at init. The compiler never modifies tracked files.
11. **Gate-time Claude work runs as one-shot `claude -p` utilities** (reviewer pass, decision-record
    drafting, init audit): fixed prompt in, structured output out, read-only tools. Not
    sessions — no state machine entry, just a logged `utility_call` event.

12. **No programmatic auth.** Sessions and gate utilities use the user's existing interactive
    login (Max subscription); Pupitre never handles tokens, API keys, or credential files.
    Trust for new worktree paths is pre-seeded in `~/.claude.json` at `pup new` (same
    mechanism Claude Code itself uses when the user accepts the dialog).

## Gate metrics

13. **Coverage = patch coverage vs a ratcheting baseline**: only added/modified lines are measured;
    their coverage ratio must meet the repo baseline. Deletions are free by construction.
14. **v1 gate slims to**: build, tests, lint, scope audit, diff-size flag, minimal ledger with
    `--accept-debt`. Patch coverage and the full debt-delta stage (duplication, dead code,
    complexity) move to v1.1 with the ratchet.

## Implementation notes

- Shared SQLite store in WAL mode so concurrent hook writes from multiple worktrees don't contend.
- Node >= 20, TypeScript, commander, better-sqlite3 (per 08-roadmap stack decision).
