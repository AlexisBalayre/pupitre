## Claude Code specifics

- `docs/conventions/*.md` reach you through `.claude/rules/`: the first Read, Edit, or Write of a file in an area injects that area's docs for the rest of the session. Never Read a conventions doc yourself; that duplicates tokens already in context.
- MCP results (codegraph) do not fire rules. Before your first edit in an area, Read one existing file there with the Read tool; the "read 2-3 similar files" rule already asks for this.

## Subagents (invoke proactively via Agent tool)

- `convention-checker` — before commit, or after ≥3 files changed in `src/`.
- `security-reviewer` — after editing hook generation, profile compilation, or anything that shells out.
- `architecture-explainer` — for *why*/*how* questions about module boundaries or the gate pipeline.
